# PROJECT EXECUTION STATE

This file is the single project-level control point for documentation rewrite and later implementation phases.

It is not a replacement for Git. Git + verified filesystem reality remain the factual source of truth.
This file controls phase/task progression and prevents Agents from drifting, skipping, or reopening decisions.

Important proof rule:

```text
PROJECT_EXECUTION_STATE.md alone is not proof of completion.
Trusted proof = this state file + local Git commit exists + filesystem reality matches the verified task.
```

## DOCUMENTATION BASELINE / TARGET

DOCUMENTATION_BASELINE:
V2

DOCUMENTATION_TARGET:
V3

V2_STATUS:
SOURCE_BASELINE_ONLY

V2_STRUCTURE_AUTHORITY:
NONE

V3_STATUS:
BLUEPRINT_APPROVED_MIGRATION_IN_PROGRESS

V3_BLUEPRINT:
docs/ai_orchestration_pack/final_docs_v3/00_INDEX.md

V3_AUTHORITY_RULE:
Each V2 document remains authoritative until the V3 index marks its successor complete and verified. The V3 index MIGRATION STATUS table is the single authority switch.

V3_OBJECTIVE:
Create the best verified documentation architecture for the project, independent of the V2 file structure.

V3_SUCCESS:
The final documentation architecture is authoritative, traceable, internally consistent, implementation-ready, recoverable, and verified. Its file count and document boundaries may differ from V2.
```

V2 documents are source material and current baseline. They are not a mandatory final structure for V3.
V3 may merge, split, rename, reorder, move, create, or remove documents when this improves execution value.
Product decisions, ADR decisions, requirements, contracts, architecture invariants, security constraints, and critical decisions must be preserved unless explicitly changed through the proper decision process.

## CURRENT TASK CONTROL

```text
CURRENT_WORKSTREAM:
DOCUMENTATION_REARCHITECTURE

CURRENT_TASK:
T-DOC-009

TASK_OBJECTIVE:
Carry cluster: create final_docs_v3/20_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md (from v2 10, Capability Firewall + deny-by-default unchanged), final_docs_v3/21_ADMIN_CONTROL_PLANE.md (from v2 11), and final_docs_v3/22_EVALUATION_AND_LEARNING.md (from v2 12) as CARRY migrations (no decision changes), mark v2 10/11/12 SUPERSEDED with pointers, and flip their MIGRATION STATUS rows in final_docs_v3/00_INDEX.md in the same commit.

TASK_STATUS:
VERIFIED_AFTER_LOCAL_COMMIT

ALLOWED_SCOPE:
- create final_docs_v3/20_SECURITY_THREAT_MODEL.md (carry of v2 10)
- create final_docs_v3/21_ADMIN_CONTROL_PLANE.md (carry of v2 11)
- create final_docs_v3/22_EVALUATION_AND_LEARNING.md (carry of v2 12)
- add SUPERSEDED pointer banners to v2 10, 11, 12 (no content deletion)
- flip MIGRATION STATUS for docs 20/21/22 in final_docs_v3/00_INDEX.md
- update this state file at the verified checkpoint

FORBIDDEN_SCOPE:
- change any security rule, admin control, evaluation gate, or decision
- migrate any other document
- implement product code
- create additional mutable state files

TASK_COMPLETION_CRITERIA:
- All three v3 files exist, content-complete, no stubs (CARRY: content preserved verbatim; only V3 authority header + traceability footer added).
- v3 20 preserves: security position, trust boundaries, threats/mitigations, Capability Firewall + deny-by-default, secrets rules, tenant isolation, AI output validation, approvals, audit events, security tests, provider-agent security risks.
- v3 21 preserves: admin modules, configuration lifecycle, control matrix, plan configuration, routing policy configuration, learning dashboard, admin audit, admin tests, model control administration, provider-agent (single + multi) administration.
- v3 22 preserves: evaluation pipeline, verification levels RAW|EVALUATED|VALIDATED|VERIFIED|GOLD, score vs confidence, grader types, evaluation record, user visibility, learning lifecycle, training eligibility, teacher model policy, promotion gates, tests.
- v2 10/11/12 carry SUPERSEDED banners pointing to successors; their content otherwise untouched.
- final_docs_v3/00_INDEX.md rows for docs 20/21/22 = COMPLETE_AUTHORITATIVE in the same commit.
- Git diff reviewed; single local commit created and verified.

VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE:
- Three successor files exist on filesystem and in commit, each with a V2->V3 traceability section stating CARRY (verbatim).
- Mechanical body-diff vs v2 sources confirms verbatim carry (only header/footer additions).
- Decision-preservation grep passed (Capability Firewall, deny-by-default, tenant isolation, verification levels, promotion gates).
- V3 index authority switch flipped for docs 20/21/22 only.
- Secret scan of changed files passed (no tokens/keys).
- Local commit created and verified; use `git rev-parse HEAD` for the exact trusted commit.

NEXT_TASK:

NEXT_TASK_OBJECTIVE:
Rewrite-compress: create final_docs_v3/40_ENGINEERING_PROTOCOL.md from v2 13 (2385 lines). Defect-justified rewrite: remove the legacy STATE.md/PROGRESS.md/HANDOFF.md scheme (conflicts with single-state decision D10/D11; single mutable state = PROJECT_EXECUTION_STATE.md), remove duplication, keep every engineering rule that still has execution value (quality gates, testing rules, definition of done, commit discipline, security engineering rules). Decisions must be preserved or explicitly superseded by D10/D11; no silent decision changes. Mark v2 13 SUPERSEDED with pointer and flip its MIGRATION STATUS row in the same commit.

## CONFIRMED DECISIONS

```text
- USER DIRECTIVE (2026-08-25, supersedes one-task-per-session stop rule): the Agent must execute as many authorized tasks as possible in the same session, in migration order, provided each task still gets its own focused commit, its own verification, and a state-file update at each verified checkpoint. Phase boundaries still hold: Phase 2 must not start in the same session that verifies Phase 1.
- Agent performs local work only unless explicit push instruction is given.
- Auto-uploader/external system owns remote synchronization.
- Local commit + verification is enough to mark a task VERIFIED.
- Remote push is not required for task verification.
- PROJECT_EXECUTION_STATE.md controls project phase/task progression.
- 22_LIGHTWEIGHT_RESUME_AND_PROGRESS_STATE_PROTOCOL.md defines how to resume.
- final_docs_v2 documents are specifications, not progress-state files.
- Resume/Handoff inside documents should be static pointers, not live progress data.
- Phase 2 implementation remains LOCKED until Phase 1 documentation is VERIFIED.
- Project state alone is not proof; it must be verified against local Git and filesystem reality.
- Do not add more mutable state files unless explicitly approved.
- Reports such as DOC_REWRITE_REPORT.md are audit artifacts, not task-control state.
- Fetch/rebase may be used for recovery/synchronization checks, but it should not become repeated per-task overhead.
- T-DOC-001 is resume/state governance preparation only, not actual documentation rewrite.
- Actual documentation re-architecture begins at T-DOC-002 after T-DOC-001 is VERIFIED.
- T-DOC-001 cleaned legacy resume/state instructions and centralized them on PROJECT_EXECUTION_STATE.md.
- V2 structure is not authoritative; V3 documentation architecture may differ from V2.
- V3 must preserve decisions/contracts/invariants, not V2 file boundaries.
- T-DOC-002 approved the V3 blueprint: final_docs_v3/00_INDEX.md is the live migration index and single authority switch.
- V3 target = 20 documents in 7 layers; merges: 05+24, 23+25, 07+21, 14+15, 16+20; superseded: 17 (by 22 + project state).
- Migration proceeds one cluster per session (T-DOC-003 … T-DOC-013); a V2 doc stays authoritative until its V3 successor is verified and marked in the V3 index.
- T-DOC-003 completed the first content migration: final_docs_v3/30 is authoritative for the Provider subsystem; v2 24 and v2 05 are SUPERSEDED baseline material.
- R006 reconciliation: external auto-uploader commits after f10ea536 (scaffold file removals, README carry) were verified as unrelated to documentation tasks; f10ea536 confirmed as ancestor of HEAD.
- R007 reconciliation: the T-DOC-003 local commit (a43b7281) was re-synchronized by the external auto-uploader as per-file sync commits ending at 26c83ad4; filesystem verification confirmed all T-DOC-003 artifacts intact (v3 doc 30 present, banners present, index flipped). Facts from filesystem, not commit hashes.
- T-DOC-004 completed the second content migration: final_docs_v3/31 is authoritative for provider scaffolding + real provider onboarding; v2 23 and v2 25 are SUPERSEDED baseline material.
- R008 reconciliation: the T-DOC-004 local commit (88965f5) was re-synchronized by the external auto-uploader as per-file sync commits ending at 1c26bda; filesystem verification confirmed all T-DOC-004 artifacts intact (v3 doc 31 present at 1304 lines, banners on v2 23/25 present, index flipped). Facts from filesystem, not commit hashes.
- T-DOC-005 completed the third content migration: final_docs_v3/12 is authoritative for Execution Graph, Agent Mode, and provider-agent orchestration; v2 07 and v2 21 are SUPERSEDED baseline material. Critical rule preserved: Provider Agent Capability != Platform Agent Runtime; platform remains the commander.
- R009 reconciliation: the T-DOC-005 local commit (2b08b04) was re-synchronized by the external auto-uploader as per-file sync commits ending at bf421c8; filesystem verification confirmed all T-DOC-005 artifacts intact (v3 doc 12 present at 887 lines, banners on v2 07/21 present, index flipped). Facts from filesystem, not commit hashes.
- T-DOC-006 completed the first carry cluster: final_docs_v3/01, 02, 03 are authoritative for product requirements, architecture baseline/invariants, and domain model; v2 01/02/03 are SUPERSEDED baseline material. All 15 architecture invariants and FR-001..FR-015 carried verbatim; no decision changed.
- R010 reconciliation: the T-DOC-006 local commit (542cb4d) was re-synchronized by the external auto-uploader as per-file sync commits ending at 1f5967a; filesystem verification confirmed all T-DOC-006 artifacts intact (v3 docs 01/02/03 present, banners on v2 01/02/03 present, index flipped). Facts from filesystem, not commit hashes.
- T-DOC-007 completed the second carry cluster: final_docs_v3/10 and 11 are authoritative for API contracts and model routing/model control; v2 04/06 are SUPERSEDED baseline material. All 5 model policy types and all 5 router selection modes carried verbatim; no decision changed.
- T-DOC-008 completed the third carry cluster: final_docs_v3/13 and 14 are authoritative for memory/context and skills/tools; v2 08/09 are SUPERSEDED baseline material. Capability Firewall check and unknown-tools-default-to-DENY carried verbatim; no decision changed.
- T-DOC-009 completed the fourth carry cluster: final_docs_v3/20, 21, 22 are authoritative for security threat model, admin control plane, and evaluation/learning; v2 10/11/12 are SUPERSEDED baseline material. Capability Firewall, deny-by-default, tenant isolation, verification levels, and promotion gates carried verbatim; no decision changed.
```

## DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT ADR / EXPLICIT USER DECISION

```text
- Architecture invariants in README and final_docs_v2.
- Provider-agnostic and model-agnostic Core.
- Model != Provider != Account.
- Router decides; Execution executes.
- LLM is not a security authority.
- Unknown capability/permission => DENY.
- Provider templates are non-functional until real providers are implemented and verified.
- Agent must not push unless explicitly instructed.
```

## RECOVERY RULE

On a new session:

```text
1. Read this file.
2. Run git status.
3. Run git rev-parse HEAD.
4. Run git diff --stat.
5. Compare this state with Git/filesystem reality.
6. Verify referenced commits exist locally when used as evidence.
7. If conflict exists, Git/filesystem reality wins for facts.
7. Reconcile this file before advancing tasks.
8. Continue only the authorized NEXT_TASK.
9. Do not infer progress from chat history.
10. Do not push unless explicitly instructed.
```

---

## STATE FAILURE MODE

If this file is missing, unreadable, empty, or invalid, the recovery state is:

```text
STATE_STATUS: RECOVERY_REQUIRED
PROJECT_PROGRESS: UNKNOWN
CURRENT_TASK: STATE_RECOVERY
PHASE_2_STATUS: LOCKED
NEXT_TASK_AUTHORIZED: NO_UNTIL_STATE_RECONSTRUCTED_AND_COMMITTED
```

Recovery must be reconstructed only from:

```text
local Git history
filesystem reality
existing repository documentation
verified commits
```

Do not infer progress from chat history or previous AI claims.
Do not create additional mutable state files.
Recreate this file only after verified reconstruction, then commit before continuing.

---

## STOP CONDITION

```text
Per USER DIRECTIVE (2026-08-25): execute as many authorized tasks as possible
in the same session, in migration order.
For EACH task:
  Verify locally.
  Update this state only at a verified checkpoint.
  Create one focused local commit.
Then continue to the next authorized task in the same session.
At session end: report all commit hashes and the next task. Stop.
Phase boundaries still hold: do not start Phase 2 in the session that verifies Phase 1.
```
